# CPS353NetProg
Class Repo

As per the intro assignment,

Hi, My name is John, former student of multiple universities, from all of which I have not been able to master practical programming, despite having technically recieved formal training in Java, C, and some Javascript. As a Senior undergrad at Gordon, I hope I can overcome that obstacle this year with this class and the Senior Seminar.

This repo is intended to hold all classwork for the CPS 353 Internet Programming class, but possibly other files related to the class.
